# Progressive Web Applications: Text Editor

## Description
This single-page app is a text editor that runs in the web browser. It meets the PWA criteria and features a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The app functions offline, utilizes IndexedDB, and is deployed using Heroku.
